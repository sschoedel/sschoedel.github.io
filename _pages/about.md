I am a master's student at Carnegie Mellon studying robotics with my advisor, [Zac Manchester](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zachary-manchester/). I did my undergrad in comptuer engineering with a concentration in controls and autonomy at Virginia Tech, where I worked with [Alexander Leonessa](https://autonomyandrobotics.centers.vt.edu/people/leonessa.html) building legged robots.

I've interned at [ModalAI](https://www.modalai.com/), [HaptX](https://haptx.com/), and [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) developing visual-inertial odometry algorithms, force-feedback robotic arms, and writing communication software for lunar rovers. I've spent the past few years developing high-speed model-predictive controllers as a member of the [Robotic Exploration Lab](https://rexlab.ri.cmu.edu/).
